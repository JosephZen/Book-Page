        <p>🌈 Challenge 3: The Rainbow Trap<br>
            <br>
            Master Pixel presented a design bursting with every color imaginable. It looked like a unicorn sneezed on it.
            <br>
            Lina cringed.
            Tip #3: Stick to a Cohesive Color Palette.
            “Too many colors can overwhelm. Choose 2–3 primary colors and complementary shades for balance.”
            <br>
            Master Pixel smiled. She was learning.<br>

            🔠 Challenge 4: The Font Frenzy<br>
            <br>
            Now came a flyer with a dozen different fonts. Some were curly, others bold, and one suspiciously looked like Comic Sans.
            <br>
            Lina chuckled.
            Tip #4: Limit Your Fonts.
            “Two fonts max—one for headings, one for body text. Consistency keeps it clean.”
            <br>
            Master Pixel chuckled too (though he secretly liked Comic Sans, but he’d never admit it).
