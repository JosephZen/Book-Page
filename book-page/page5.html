        <p>📏 Challenge 5: The Crooked Kingdom<br>
            <br>
            Master Pixel showed her a layout where nothing lined up—text floated awkwardly, images were misaligned.
            <br>
            Lina straightened it out.
            Tip #5: Use Grids and Alignment.
            “Grids create structure. Alignment makes designs feel organized and professional.”
            <br>
            Master Pixel was impressed.<br>
            <br>
            📱 Challenge 6: The Tiny Trap<br>
            Then came a mobile design where everything was too small to tap.
            <br>
            Lina adjusted the spacing.
            Tip #6: Design for Usability.
            “Good design isn’t just pretty—it’s functional. Think about the user’s experience, especially on different devices.”
            <br>
            Master Pixel’s eyes twinkled with approval.
