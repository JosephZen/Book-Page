        <p>ðŸŽ¨ The Tale of the Lost Designer: 7 Timeless Design Tips ðŸŽ¨<br>
            <br>
            Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Creativia, there lived a young designer named Lina. 
            She had passion, ambition, and an endless collection of colorful sticky notesâ€”but something was missing. 
            No matter how hard she tried, her designs feltâ€¦ flat. They didnâ€™t pop. They didnâ€™t speak. 
            Frustrated, Lina decided to seek out the legendary Master Pixel, a wise old designer known to live in the enchanted Grid Forest, 
            where every tree grew in perfect alignment.
            After a long journey (and way too many coffee breaks), Lina found Master Pixel, 
            who agreed to teach her the 7 Timeless Design Tipsâ€”but only if she could solve a series of creative challenges.<br></p><br>
