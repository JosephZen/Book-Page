        <p>🗒️ Challenge 1: The Curse of Clutter<br>
            <br>
            Master Pixel handed Lina a poster crowded with text, images, and random doodles.
            “What’s wrong with this design?” he asked.
            <br>
            Lina squinted. Then it hit her.
            Tip #1: Embrace White Space.
            “Design needs breathing room,” she said. “White space isn’t empty—it helps important elements stand out.”
            <br>
            Master Pixel nodded.<br>
            <br>
            🎯 Challenge 2: The Lost Focus<br>
            Next, he showed her a website with buttons scattered everywhere. “Where should I click?” he grumbled.
            <br>
            Lina realized the problem.
            Tip #2: Establish Visual Hierarchy.
            “Use size, color, and contrast to guide the viewer’s eye,” she said. “The most important stuff should pop first.”
            <br>
            Another nod from the master.
